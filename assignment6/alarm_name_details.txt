The ALARM ("A Logical Alarm Reduction Mechanism") is a Bayesian network designed to provide an alarm message system for patient monitoring.

Number of nodes: 37
Number of arcs/edges: 46
Number of parameters: 509

D   PULMEMBOLUS (pulmonary embolus): a two-level factor with levels TRUE and FALSE.
D   INTUBATION (intubation): a three-level factor with levels NORMAL, ESOPHAGEAL and ONESIDED.
D   KINKEDTUBE (kinked tube): a two-level factor with levels TRUE and FALSE.
D   DISCONNECT (disconnection): a two-level factor with levels TRUE and FALSE.
    LVEDVOLUME(left ventricular end-diastolic volume): a three-level factor with levels LOW, NORMAL and HIGH.

Variable Categorization:
a) 8 Diagnosis (root) variables: Disconnect, KinkedTube, Intubation, Pulmembolus, Anaphylaxis, LVfailure, Hypovolemia, ErrCauter
b) 16 Measurements (Evidence/Findings) variables: CVP, PCWP, BP, HRBP, HREKG, HRSAT, EXPCO2, PAP, HISTORY, CO, TPR, FIO2, PRESS, MINVOL, MINVOLSET(MV), SAO2
c) 13 Intermediate variables.

If an electrocauter is used, the EKG monitor is equally likely to show a low, normal, or high reading independent of the patient's real heart rate.
If an electrocauter is NOT used, the EKG monitor is likely showing the real heart rate.

Example: Physiological measurements:
1. BP: 120/80 mmHg 
2. Heart rate: 80/min					HR
3. Inspired oxygen concentration: 50%
4. Tidal volume: 500 ml 				TV
5. Respiratory rate: 10/min				RR
6. MINVOLSET: minute ventilation= TV*RR
7. Breathing pressure: 50 mbar				Press
8. Measured minute ventilation: 1.2 l/min
